Resume Management - SQL Project  

📌 Project Overview  
This "Resume Management" project is designed to automate the categorization of resumes based on job roles. Using SQL, I have structured and analyzed a dataset of resumes to extract meaningful insights, such as top skills per category, experience levels, and education qualifications.  

This project serves as a **Resume Management Project** demonstrating hands-on experience in database management, data analysis, and query optimization.
